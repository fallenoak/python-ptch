# python-ptch

A small library to read and apply Blizzard PTCH files.

PTCH is a container format for binary patches based on the
[BSDIFF40](http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) format.

The format is used as part of Blizzard's patching toolset for
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. It was dropped in later games
in favour of [CASC](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html).
